Test repository

This is the read me file for David Gleason's first github repository.
I'm leaning to use GitHub primarily so that I can get access to the EDM Council FIBO ontology working groups

I may also want to use GitHub to collaborate on a book that I might write.  It seems like it might be a good way to share drafts of chapters, etc.  Wow, I'm a geek, huh.
